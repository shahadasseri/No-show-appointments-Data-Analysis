# Project title:
No-show-appointments-Data-Analysis
## overview 
In this project, I’m going to move around all the Data Analysis processes and work with them in more detail inshallah. I selected the Dataset which talks about (No-show appointments) This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment to analyse it. it contains 14 columns: (PatientId, AppointmentID, Gender, scheduledDay, AppointmentDay, Age, Neighbourhood, Scholarship, Hypertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism, Handicap, SMS_received, Not-show) and 110527 rows before any modifications. I have questions that I’ll move around all the Data Analysis processes to answer it:
1.what is the appointment rate of Show-up VS No Show-up?
2.What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?
### What Software Do I Need?

To complete this project, i'll require the following softwares:

- Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
